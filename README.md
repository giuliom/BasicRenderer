Basic Renderer is a simple renderer made with fun and learning in mind.

Features planned:
* Rasterization
* Classic Ray-Tracing
* Path-Tracing

The solution includes two projects:
- BasicRenderer aka the actual renderer itself that can be built as standalone executable
- QtGUI a graphical interface for BasicRenderer made with Qt 5.15.0
